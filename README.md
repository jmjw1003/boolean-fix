This is more because I found it humourous than a serious project ;)

# Go here for a packaged version
Turns out some other memelord has had the same idea and already packaged it; https://pypi.org/project/booleanfix/

# Lower case booleans, added null
Booleans, null & none in lower case to match other languages (...and because I'm too lazy to press shift)

# Code
Literally just assigning variables, I won't bother to package it up since someone else already has but you would just import * or true, false, etc. from this.
```
true = True
false = False
null = None
none = None
```
